Hola, World!!

Whoever has the power to punish must strive to remain ignorant of the culprit in every event, and for as long as possible. For as soon as the perpetrator is known, their courtiers will press as hard as the Furies for judgement. In America, this phenomenon of “justice” is not only in, by, and through the press corps, but exists nonetheless however much the ordinary citizen might like to deny it. It is as they say, “Buyer beware”, under all conditions and in every circumstance.
